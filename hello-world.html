    <p>An experiment in blogging, coding, and living. </p>
<p>I've never been one for going the extra mile, learning in my free time, or following through with a hobby for very long. Soon I'm hoping for this to change though. After some remodeling in my office over the next month, I plan on utilizing my space more and more to learn and hopefully excel. </p>
<p>Planned projects atm are along the lines of:</p>
<ol>
<li>NTBD - a rewrite of www.750words.com.  I really like the idea, but I'd like to have my own version of it running, and not hosted on someone else's server.</li>
<li>Budget Software - something to help me manage/predict/budget my finances. I remember seeing a version of this awhile back that was written in Rails. I'm not too keen on running a webserver all the time just for my budgets. A simple command line app will do just fine.</li>
<li>A friend and I are throwing around ideas for a website for managing recipes and current inventory of what you have available at your house to make said recipe.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, who knows where this will go, I just hope it's worth it.</p>
